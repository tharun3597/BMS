#  Bluetooth Attendance Management System

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
- The project is a software useful for educational institutions and at many other places for taking attendance.

### PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
- Storing the Bluetooth addresses of various users in the database and identify their Bluetooth addresses in the future use them to verify their presence.

### SCOPE OF THE WORK: 
- This project will provide additional functionalities such as display of attendance percentage to students and faculty etc…Thus it will be helpful in avoiding the old conventional method of taking manual attendance which is quite time consuming and also defective at times.

### STAKEHOLDERS: 
- A stakeholder is anybody who can affect or is affected by an organization, strategy or project. Some definitions suggest that stakeholders are those who have the power to impact an organization or project in some way.

####  Student: 
- They can check their attendance percentage and also check the attendance status of a particular given day.

#### Faculty: 
- They are the ones taking the attendance with the help of the system developed.

#### Administrator:
- They are concerned with the installation and maintenance of the system and send a proper report to the development team regarding the performance of the system.

#### Developer: 
- They are responsible for development of application within financial and time constraints.

### CONSTRAINTS: 
Following are the constraints which are mandated before the project gets under way:
#### Financial constraint: 
- This project requires Django software which is free and hence one need not worry much about the financial problems since the devices used are phones which are already used by the students and hence no need for extra expenditure.

#### Time constraint: 
- Time is required to have an in-depth understanding of technologies required. Time is required to discuss the features of the product with consent of all team members and users.

#### Knowledge constraint: 
- Inadequate knowledge of working and functionalities of Django. Inadequate knowledge of availability of libraries required for the recognition and finding the Bluetooth address of a system.

### REQUIREMENTS:
#### Functional Requirements: 
- The faculty must be able to check the attendance regarding their subjects for all students. Students should be able to check their percentage of attendance. Admin should approve the registration of faculty and students.

#### Non-Functional Requirements:

##### Speed and latency Requirements: 
- Since we are  developing a web application it shouldn’t take much time for loading of the page. In the events of crash, the system should maintain the records safe.

##### Availability: 
- It will be available to the users 24*7 and also accessible from phones.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED: 
- The programming language used is python since it has all the libraries required for the recognition and retrieval of Bluetooth addresses. Bootstrap is used to avoid the excess css code length and also for predefined cool styles. Pycharm is an IDE used for Django which also contains in-built database for storage of data.

### APPROACH: 
- An incremental approach is required which involves testing and debugging of every functionality of the code. After testing a full beta model has to release to check for any bugs and enhance user experience by the reviews of people. After the release of the final product maintenance of it is required for fix any further issues.

### EVALUATION: 
- There shouldn’t be delay in the project development and all the requirements which were aimed earlier should be achieved. Based on the requirement specifications we will evaluate the cost so that it stays within the budget. Final deadline for the project needs to be evaluated and new requirements according to current needs have to be implemented efficiently and cost effectively.

### REVIEWS: 
- The Final stakeholders will review the project and decide upon the further modifications to be made to the project. The unique selling points of the product will be highlighted to impress the stakeholders. The Further modifications and improvements to the software features and requirements will be carried out based on the reviews.

### OPEN ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS: 
- While handling such a project where stakeholders have bit conflicting and inter dependable demands: following issues are to be tackled:

- Problem 1: Everybody wants to know what it's going to cost. 
- Problem 2: Requirements aren't clearly defined.
- Problem 3: Requirements need to change for business reasons.
- Problem 4: Requirements prevent changing to a more suitable solution.

- There are of course certain measures to be taken beforehand as calamities do not occur with permission! Some of the general solutions to the above mentioned problems are as follows:
- Solution 1: Agree to a budget up front.
- Solution 2, 3, 4: Always start the project with confined requirements and do anticipation beforehand to avoid the agony of making tedious changes to the software.
